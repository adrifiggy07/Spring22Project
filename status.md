Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have built around half of the pong game so far, made the paddles, the ball and currently working on the ball movement and ricochet when it hits the paddles. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't implemented the quirks as of yet, I'm looking to make the ball go faster everytime it rebounds and maybe have a reverse controls function that swaps the controls to make it a little more difficult. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Honestly the ball movement is tough especially when it comes to it ricocheting off the paddles and it speeding up. I encountered a problem when every time a point was scored, the ball maintained the speed it last had, so the last 5-6 points were automatic because the ball just kept FLYING and it was too fast for the players to move their paddles in time anyways. So I'm trying to get it so that the ball speed resets every time it is a new round.
