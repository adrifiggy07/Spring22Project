# Spring22Project
# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I have been thinking about making a pong game for the longest time, but I wanted to make it more difficult. Like every time the ball returns it gets slightly faster, and after a certain amount of tine it shakes the screen to make it more innacurate. As well as possibly some other things. But I want to make it a more difficult version of the classic game. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan to do this on my own as of now. 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I'm not exactly sure how to code some of these special quirks. Making the game itself is probably more straightforward but yes I think I will need help to make the ball bounce slightly faster every time it returns + screen shake.

# What are some challenges I faced during the project now that I am done?

I think maybe I shot too high and overestinmated what I could've gotten done, I also wanted a "screen shake" feature that happens randomly to throw off the players, kinda similarly to when you have to shoot free throws in the video game of NBA 2k and the crowd gets roudy the screen shakes. But I just decided to settle for the pong speeding up the longer the round goes on. I enjoyed this final project because I had to implement things I knew as well as stuff I didn't know that I had to look up or pull from other python pong games. I struggled with the ball movement the most. Because before I had the ball speed up, however when a point was scored, it maintained that same speed. So it'd slingshot and there'd be like 4 points scored in 10 seconds because the players literally aren't fast enough to move their paddles. So the biggest struggle was finding a happy medium for the ball speed. I wish I had more time to work on it but I think I'm okay with at least having a functional game of pong with at least one stipulation.
