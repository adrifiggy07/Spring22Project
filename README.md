## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I have been thinking about making a pong game for the longest time, but I wanted to make it more difficult. Like every time the ball returns it gets slightly faster, and after a certain amount of tine it shakes the screen to make it more innacurate. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan to do this on my own as go now. 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I'm not exactly sure how to code some of these special quirks. Making the game itself is probably more straightforward but yes I think I will need help to make the ball bounce slightly faster every time it returns + screen shake.
