# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pong on Roids?

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A more challenging game of pong. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

So essentially I wanted to make a game of pong. But have some differences be that the "ball" moves slightly quicker every time it is returned, as well as having the screen shake randomly. I will be using IDLE. It will be using turtles mostly. I've been brainstorming a plan and trying to map out how to do this. I will be looking at other Python Pong games to draw inspiration/ learn from to make a functional version of my own. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Not applicable. 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will at least hope to make a decent running game of Pong to be honest. I feel like I am okay with coding, definitely not the greatest out there. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be an amusing slightly more challenging game of pong. If I an able to do this then I'd be happy. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Best case is a great game of pong that I can find myself going back to from time to time. If I find it has high replayability then I would be over the moon. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I plan to research how to build a simple game of pong just to see some examples out there because obviously I haven't done it before. I am working alone so I'm beginning the planning stages this week/weekend. I think I will need to do more research on turtles and making the game screen shake which at the moment I have no idea how to do. I think I have the ability to pull it off however and will ask the Professor and my TA if I hit a wall.
